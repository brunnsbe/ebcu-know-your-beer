    <h2>What is Know Your Beer?</h2>
    <p>
      Know Your Beer is a Europe-wide consumer education campaign that helps people understand beer labels,
      make informed choices, and know their rights when buying beer in shops or ordering in bars and restaurants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign is developed and maintained by EBCU (European Beer Consumers Union), a federation of
      independent consumer organisations across Europe dedicated to promoting beer culture and protecting
      consumer interests.
    </p>

    <h2>Why this campaign?</h2>
    <p>
      Beer labels can be confusing. While they're technically correct, the information isn't always easy
      to interpret. Terms like "brewed for", "distributed by", and "produced in" can obscure important
      details about who actually made your beer and where.
    </p>
    <p>
      New EU regulations coming into effect in 2025/2026 will require more transparency about ingredients
      and nutrition. This campaign helps consumers understand both current labels and the new information
      that will become available.
