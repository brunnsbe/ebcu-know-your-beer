<h2>What's in beer?</h2>
<p>
  Traditional beer is made from four basic ingredients: water, malted barley (or other grains), hops, and yeast.
  Many beers also include additional ingredients like fruits, spices, honey, or other flavourings.
</p>

<h2>What labels must show today</h2>
<p>
  Under current EU regulations, beer labels are only required to show:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Allergens</strong> - Any of the 14 major allergens must be highlighted (usually in bold or capitals)</li>
  <li><strong>Alcohol content</strong> - The ABV percentage</li>
  <li><strong>Volume</strong> - How much is in the container</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unlike most food products, beer has not been required to list all ingredients. This exemption is changing.
</p>

<h2>What's changing in 2025/2026</h2>
<p>
  New EU regulations require beers to provide:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A complete ingredients list</li>
  <li>Nutrition information (energy, at minimum)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This information can be provided on the label itself, or via electronic means such as a QR code.
  When you scan a QR code on a beer label, you should be able to access the full ingredient list and
  nutrition facts.
</p>

  <p class="font-medium text-gray-700">About QR codes</p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    QR codes on labels should link to ingredient and nutrition information. However, they may also
    link to marketing content. Make sure you're looking at the actual product information, not just
    promotional material.

<h2>Common allergens in beer</h2>
<p>
  The most relevant allergens for beer are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gluten</strong> - Present in beers made with barley, wheat, rye, or oats (most beers)</li>
  <li><strong>Sulphites</strong> - Sometimes added or naturally occurring</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Other allergens that may occasionally appear include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Milk/lactose</strong> - In some stouts and sweet beers</li>
  <li><strong>Nuts</strong> - In certain specialty beers</li>
  <li><strong>Fish/isinglass</strong> - Sometimes used as a fining agent (not always declared)</li>
</ul>

      <span class="text-gray-600">If concerned about fining agents, look for "unfined" or "vegan" labels</span>

    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
      <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-5 h-5 rounded border-2 border-gray-300 mt-0.5"></div>
      <span class="text-gray-600">For gluten-free beer, look for certified "gluten-free" labels, not just "low gluten"</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Gluten-free and low-gluten beers</h2>
<p>
  There's an important distinction:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gluten-free</strong> - Must contain less than 20 ppm gluten. Can be made from gluten-free grains or from barley with gluten removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Low-gluten</strong> or "gluten-reduced" - Contains reduced gluten but may still affect people with coeliac disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity, look for certified gluten-free products rather than
  "gluten-reduced" or "crafted to remove gluten" claims.
</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>
  You have the right to allergen information whether buying in a shop or ordering in a bar. In the on-trade,
  staff must be able to provide this information on request. If they can't, that's a potential compliance issue.
