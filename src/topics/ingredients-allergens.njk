<h2>What's in beer?</h2>
<p>
  Traditional beer is made from four basic ingredients: water, malted barley (or other grains), hops, and yeast.
  Many beers also include additional ingredients like fruits, spices, honey, or other flavourings.

    Understanding what's in your beer starts with reading the label and knowing what information should be available.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>What labels must show today</h2>
<p>
  Under current EU regulations, beer labels are only required to show:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Allergens</strong> - Any of the 14 major allergens must be highlighted (usually in bold or capitals)</li>
  <li><strong>Alcohol content</strong> - The ABV percentage</li>
  <li><strong>Volume</strong> - How much is in the container</li>
  <li><strong>Date of minimum durability</strong> - Best-before date</li>
  <li><strong>Name and address of producer</strong> - Or importer to the EU if it's produced outside the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unlike most food products, beer has not been required to list all ingredients. This exemption still exists at EU level,
  though the industry has made voluntary commitments to provide more information.
</p>

<h2>The current situation: voluntary, not mandatory</h2>
<p>
  Unlike wine (which has mandatory labeling requirements since December 2023), beer remains exempt from
  EU-wide ingredient and nutrition labeling laws. However, the brewing industry signed a
  <a href="https://brewup.eu/documents/advocate/memorandum-of-understanding-on-listing-ingredients-and-nutrition-information-for-alcoholic-beverages" class="text-ebcu-gold hover:text-ebcu-gold-dark font-medium">Memorandum of Understanding</a>
  with the European Commission in 2019, voluntarily committing to provide:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A complete ingredients list</li>
  <li>Nutrition information (energy, at minimum)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By 2022, <strong>95% of beer volumes</strong> sold in bottles and cans in the EU included an ingredients list,
  and 88% showed energy values according to
  <a href="https://brewersofeurope.eu/our-priorities/labelling/" class="text-ebcu-gold hover:text-ebcu-gold-dark font-medium">The Brewers of Europe</a>.
  This information can appear on the label itself or via electronic means such as a QR code.

  <p class="font-medium text-gray-700">What this means for you</p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    Most beers now include ingredient and nutrition information voluntarily, but it's not legally required.
    If a beer doesn't provide this information, it's not breaking any EU law - though you might choose to
    buy from brewers who are more transparent.

<h2>Ireland leading the way</h2>
<p>
  Ireland is set to become the first EU country to mandate comprehensive alcohol labeling.
  Under the <a href="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/si/249/made/en/print" class="text-ebcu-gold hover:text-ebcu-gold-dark font-medium">Public Health (Alcohol) (Labelling) Regulations 2023</a>,
  all alcohol products sold in Ireland will need to include calorie content, grams of alcohol, and health warnings
  including cancer risk information. Originally planned for May 2026, implementation has been
  <a href="https://www.arthurcox.com/knowledge/alcohol-labelling-in-ireland-timeline-for-compliance-deferred/" class="text-ebcu-gold hover:text-ebcu-gold-dark font-medium">deferred to September 2028</a>.
  This pioneering legislation may influence future EU-wide policy.

  <p class="font-medium text-gray-700">About QR codes</p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    Many brewers now use QR codes to provide ingredient and nutrition information digitally. This approach
    is mandatory for wine and increasingly common for beer. However, QR codes may also link to marketing content.
    Make sure you're looking at the actual product information, not just promotional material. The information
    should be accessible without requiring an app download or account creation.

<h2>Common allergens in beer</h2>
<p>
  The most relevant allergens for beer are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gluten</strong> - Present in beers made with barley, wheat, rye, or oats (most beers)</li>
  <li><strong>Sulphites</strong> - Sometimes added or naturally occurring</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Other allergens that may occasionally appear include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Milk/lactose</strong> - In some stouts and sweet beers</li>
  <li><strong>Nuts</strong> - In certain specialty beers</li>
  <li><strong>Fish/isinglass</strong> - Sometimes used as a fining agent (not always declared)</li>
</ul>

    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
      <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-5 h-5 rounded border-2 border-gray-300 mt-0.5"></div>
      <span class="text-gray-600">For gluten-free beer, look for certified "gluten-free" labels, not just "low gluten"</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Gluten-free and low-gluten beers</h2>
<p>
  There's an important distinction:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gluten-free</strong> - Must contain less than 20 ppm gluten. Can be made from gluten-free grains or from barley with gluten removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Low-gluten</strong> or "gluten-reduced" - Contains reduced gluten but may still affect people with coeliac disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity, look for certified gluten-free products rather than
  "gluten-reduced" or "crafted to remove gluten" claims.
</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>
  You have the right to allergen information whether buying in a shop or ordering in a bar. In the on-trade,
  staff must be able to provide this information on request. If they can't, that's a potential compliance issue.
</p>
