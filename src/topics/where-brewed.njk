<h2>Finding the brewing location</h2>
<p>
  The country of origin is required on beer labels, but the specific brewing location often isn't.
  Here's how to find out where your beer was actually made.
</p>

<div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5 my-6">

  <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">
    Location and legal responsibility are separate questions. For how to identify the brand owner,
    contract brewers, and what producer phrases on labels mean, see
    <a href="/topics/who-made-it/" class="text-ebcu-blue hover:text-ebcu-blue-dark underline">Who made this beer?</a>

    Knowing where your beer was actually brewed helps you make informed choices about what you're buying.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>What labels must show</h2>
<p>
  EU law requires:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name and address of the food business operator (producer, packer, or importer)</li>
  <li>Country of origin (in most cases)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  However, the address shown might be a head office, not the brewing facility. A beer might list a
  Copenhagen address while being brewed in Belgium.
</p>

<h2>Common misleading patterns</h2>

<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">Location-themed branding</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      A beer with German-sounding name, German flag imagery, and "German-style lager" text might be
      brewed anywhere. Unless it says "brewed in Germany", don't assume.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">Historic brewery claims</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      "Established 1847" or similar claims refer to the brand's history, not necessarily continuous
      production at the original site. The current production might be elsewhere entirely.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">Corporate address vs brewing address</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      The required address might be a corporate headquarters, not the brewery. Look specifically
      for brewing location information, not just any address.
    </p>
  </div>

<h2>EU quality logos on beer labels</h2>
<p>
  The EU operates three quality schemes that protect product names and traditions. All three can
  appear on beer labels, though PGI is by far the most common for beer.
</p>

<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">PGI — Protected Geographical Indication</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      A PGI means at least one stage of production, processing, or preparation takes place in the
      defined geographical area, and the product has a specific quality, reputation, or characteristic
      attributable to that origin. PGI is the most common EU protection applied to beer. Labels may
      display the EU's blue circular PGI logo alongside the protected name.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">PDO — Protected Designation of Origin</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      A PDO is a stricter designation: all stages of production, processing, and preparation must
      occur in the defined area, and the quality or characteristics must be essentially or exclusively
      due to that geographical environment. PDO is less common for beer than PGI.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">TSG — Traditional Speciality Guaranteed</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      A TSG protects a traditional production method or recipe rather than a geographical origin.
      The product does not need to come from a specific place — it just needs to be made in the
      traditional way defined in the specification. Finnish sahti, the traditional farmhouse ale
      brewed with juniper and often rye, holds TSG status.

<h2>Other protected designations</h2>
<p>
  Some logos on beer labels are protected designations that are not EU geographical indications but
  are governed by their own rules and certifying bodies.
</p>

<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">Authentic Trappist Product</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      A certification controlled by the International Trappist Association, not an EU geographical
      indication. To display it, the beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery,
      under monastic supervision, with profits going primarily to the monastery or to charitable
      causes. It is not tied to a specific country or region — several EU member states have
      Trappist breweries.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">Certified Belgian Abbey Beer</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      A certification managed by the Belgian Brewers association, distinct from the Trappist
      designation. To use it, a beer must have a genuine, documented connection to a recognised
      Belgian abbey — typically through a licensing agreement where the abbey receives a share of
      revenue — and the recipe must be approved by the abbey. Unlike Trappist, the beer does not
      need to be brewed on monastery grounds. The certification applies only to beers with a link
      to a specific Belgian abbey.
