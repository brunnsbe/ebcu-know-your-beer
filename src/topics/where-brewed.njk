<h2>Finding the brewing location</h2>
<p>
  The country of origin is required on beer labels, but the specific brewing location often isn't.
  Here's how to find out where your beer was actually made.
</p>

<h2>What labels must show</h2>
<p>
  EU law requires:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name and address of the food business operator (producer, packer, or importer)</li>
  <li>Country of origin (in most cases)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  However, the address shown might be a head office, not the brewing facility. A beer might list a
  Copenhagen address while being brewed in Belgium.
</p>

<h2>What to look for</h2>

      A beer with German-sounding name, German flag imagery, and "German-style lager" text might be
      brewed anywhere. Unless it says "brewed in Germany", don't assume.

      "Established 1847" or similar claims refer to the brand's history, not necessarily continuous
      production at the original site. The current production might be elsewhere entirely.

      The required address might be a corporate headquarters, not the brewery. Look specifically
      for brewing location information, not just any address.
