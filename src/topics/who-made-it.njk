<h2>Understanding producer information</h2>
<p>
  Beer labels include various phrases about who's responsible for the product. These terms have specific
  meanings, but they're not always clear to consumers.
</p>

<h2>Common phrases explained</h2>

<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Brewed by" or "Brewed at"</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      This indicates the actual brewery that produced the beer. The brewery named is where the brewing happened.
      This is the most direct statement of origin.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Brewed for" or "Produced for"</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      This means the beer was contract-brewed. Another brewery made the beer on behalf of the brand owner.
      The brand owner typically designs the recipe and owns the brand, but doesn't own the production facility.
      This is a common and legal practice, but the actual brewing location isn't stated.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Distributed by" or "Imported by"</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      This tells you who's handling distribution or import, not who brewed the beer. The distributor may
      have no connection to the brewing process. You'll need to look elsewhere for producer information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Produced in [Country]"</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      This indicates the country of production but not the specific brewery. A beer "produced in Belgium"
      could be made by any of hundreds of breweries.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>
  Knowing who actually brewed your beer helps you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand what you're paying for</li>
  <li>Make informed choices about supporting specific breweries</li>
  <li>Recognise when brands are produced by different breweries than you might assume</li>
  <li>Avoid confusion when the same brand is brewed in different locations for different markets</li>
</ul>

<div class="rounded-xl border border-ebcu-blue/30 bg-ebcu-blue/5 p-5 my-6">
  <p class="font-medium text-gray-700">Contract brewing isn't bad</p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    Contract brewing is a legitimate business practice. Many excellent beers are contract-brewed, and
    many breweries both brew their own brands and produce beers for others. The issue isn't the practice
    itself, but clarity about who made what.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Good practice example</h2>
<p>
  Clear producer information helps consumers make informed choices. Here's an example of transparent brewery identification in the on-trade:
</p>

<div class="my-6">
  <img src="/assets/images/porterhousetaps.jpg" alt="Three Porterhouse tap badges clearly showing the brewery of production for each beer" class="w-full rounded-lg border border-gray-200 shadow-sm">
  <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2 italic">
    Example: Porterhouse tap badges clearly showing the brewery of production for each beer.
  </p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Common scenarios</h2>

<h3>Brand vs brewery ownership</h3>
<p>
  Many beer brands that appear independent are owned by larger brewing groups. The label might feature
  a small brewery's name and story, while the beer is actually produced at a facility owned by a
  multinational. This isn't necessarily disclosed on the label.
</p>

<h3>Multi-site production</h3>
<p>
  Some brands are produced at multiple locations. A beer might be brewed in one country for sale there,
  and licensed or contract-brewed elsewhere for other markets. The "same" beer can taste different
  depending on where it was actually made.
</p>

<h3>Nomad or "cuckoo" brewing</h3>
<p>
  Some brewers don't own their own equipment but rent time at other breweries. They may be present
  during brewing and use their own recipes, or they may simply contract out production. Labels
  typically say "brewed for" or "brewed by [brand] at [location]".
  You may also see the term "gypsy brewing" used for this practice — this term can be considered
  offensive and is best avoided.
</p>

<h2>Independent brewer logos</h2>
<p>
  Some beer labels carry logos indicating the brewery is a member of an independent brewer association.
  These are membership marks, not quality awards.
</p>

<div class="rounded-xl border border-ebcu-blue/30 bg-ebcu-blue/5 p-5 my-6">
  <p class="font-medium text-gray-700">What these logos indicate</p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    Independent brewer logos generally mean the brewery has declared it is not owned or controlled by
    a large international brewing group, and is a member of a national trade association representing
    independent brewers. They say something about ownership structure — not about brewing method,
    ingredients, or quality.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  National associations of independent brewers exist across many European countries, and some issue
  logos or certification marks that member breweries may display on their packaging. Definitions of
  "independent" vary between organisations. Common criteria include ownership thresholds (for example,
  not more than a set percentage owned by a large brewer or outside investor) and sometimes production
  volume caps. The precise criteria behind any specific logo are set by the issuing association and
  available on their website.

      <span class="text-gray-600">Absence of a logo does not mean the brewery is not independent — membership is voluntary</span>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">

      <span class="text-gray-600">To verify membership, check the issuing association's member directory</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>If the label isn't clear</h2>
<p>
  If you can't determine who actually brewed a beer from the label:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search online for the brand name plus "brewery" or "brewed by"</li>
  <li>Check the brand's website for production information</li>
  <li>Look for batch code formats that might indicate the facility</li>
  <li>Ask the retailer or bar staff</li>
</ul>

    Knowing <em>who</em> made a beer is a separate question from knowing <em>where</em> it was physically
    brewed. For guidance on finding the brewing location — including what EU quality logos and address
