<h2>Understanding producer information</h2>
<p>
  Beer labels include various phrases about who's responsible for the product. These terms have specific
  meanings, but they're not always clear to consumers.
</p>

<h2>Common phrases explained</h2>

<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Brewed by" or "Brewed at"</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      This indicates the actual brewery that produced the beer. The brewery named is where the brewing happened.
      This is the most direct statement of origin.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Brewed for" or "Produced for"</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      This means the beer was contract-brewed. Another brewery made the beer on behalf of the brand owner.
      The brand owner typically designs the recipe and owns the brand, but doesn't own the production facility.
      This is a common and legal practice, but the actual brewing location isn't stated.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Distributed by" or "Imported by"</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      This tells you who's handling distribution or import, not who brewed the beer. The distributor may
      have no connection to the brewing process. You'll need to look elsewhere for producer information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Produced in [Country]"</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      This indicates the country of production but not the specific brewery. A beer "produced in Belgium"
      could be made by any of hundreds of breweries.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>
  Knowing who actually brewed your beer helps you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand what you're paying for</li>
  <li>Make informed choices about supporting specific breweries</li>
  <li>Recognise when brands are produced by different breweries than you might assume</li>
  <li>Avoid confusion when the same brand is brewed in different locations for different markets</li>
</ul>

<div class="rounded-xl border border-ebcu-blue/30 bg-ebcu-blue/5 p-5 my-6">
  <p class="font-medium text-gray-700">Contract brewing isn't bad</p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    Contract brewing is a legitimate business practice. Many excellent beers are contract-brewed, and
    many breweries both brew their own brands and produce beers for others. The issue isn't the practice
    itself, but clarity about who made what.
  </p>

<h2>What to look for</h2>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4">Checklist</h3>

    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
      <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-5 h-5 rounded border-2 border-gray-300 mt-0.5"></div>
      <span class="text-gray-600">Look for "brewed by" or "brewed at" to find the actual producer</span>

      <span class="text-gray-600">If it says "brewed for", the actual brewery is different from the brand</span>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
      <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-5 h-5 rounded border-2 border-gray-300 mt-0.5"></div>
      <span class="text-gray-600">Check for a full address - this is often the clearest indicator</span>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
      <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-5 h-5 rounded border-2 border-gray-300 mt-0.5"></div>
      <span class="text-gray-600">Look for batch codes or brewery codes that might indicate the production site</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Common scenarios</h2>

<h3>Brand vs brewery ownership</h3>
<p>
  Many beer brands that appear independent are owned by larger brewing groups. The label might feature
  a small brewery's name and story, while the beer is actually produced at a facility owned by a
  multinational. This isn't necessarily disclosed on the label.
</p>

<h3>Multi-site production</h3>
<p>
  Some brands are produced at multiple locations. A beer might be brewed in one country for sale there,
  and licensed or contract-brewed elsewhere for other markets. The "same" beer can taste different
  depending on where it was actually made.
</p>

<h3>"Gypsy" or "cuckoo" brewing</h3>
<p>
  Some brewers don't own their own equipment but rent time at other breweries. They may be present
  during brewing and use their own recipes, or they may simply contract out production. Labels
  typically say "brewed for" or "brewed by [brand] at [location]".
</p>

<h2>If the label isn't clear</h2>
<p>
  If you can't determine who actually brewed a beer from the label:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search online for the brand name plus "brewery" or "brewed by"</li>
  <li>Check the brand's website for production information</li>
  <li>Look for batch code formats that might indicate the facility</li>
  <li>Ask the retailer or bar staff</li>
</ul>
