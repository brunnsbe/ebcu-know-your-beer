<h2>Understanding ABV</h2>
<p>
  ABV (Alcohol By Volume) tells you what percentage of the drink is pure alcohol. It's required on all beer labels in the EU.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Non-alcoholic / alcohol-free:</strong> Up to 0.5% ABV - full-flavoured beers with minimal or no alcohol</li>
  <li><strong>Low-alcohol:</strong> 0.5-1.2% ABV - reduced alcohol options</li>
  <li><strong>Session beers:</strong> Generally under 5% ABV - designed for longer drinking sessions</li>
  <li><strong>Standard strength:</strong> 4-6% ABV - most lagers and pale ales</li>
  <li><strong>Strong beers:</strong> 7-10% ABV - many Belgian styles, IPAs, stouts</li>
  <li><strong>Very strong:</strong> Over 10% ABV - barleywines, imperial stouts, some specialty beers</li>
</ul>

    Beer styles vary widely in strength, flavour, and appearance. Understanding ABV and style helps you choose the right beer.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Standard drinks and units</h2>
<p>
  A "standard drink" or "unit" of alcohol varies by country, but generally represents about 10g of pure alcohol. This helps you track consumption regardless of the drink's strength.
</p>

<div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5 my-6">
  <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4">Quick calculation</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
    To estimate units in a beer: multiply the volume (in litres) by the ABV percentage.
  </p>
  <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
    <li>330ml at 5% = 0.33 × 5 = 1.65 units</li>
    <li>500ml at 4% = 0.5 × 4 = 2 units</li>
    <li>330ml at 8% = 0.33 × 8 = 2.64 units</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Beer styles and flavour expectations</h2>
<p>
  Style names on labels give you clues about what to expect. While not regulated, common styles have established characteristics:
</p>

<div class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 my-6">
  <div class="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-4">
    <h3 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Lagers</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Clean, crisp, often light. Pilsners are hoppy lagers; Helles and Märzen are maltier.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-4">
    <h3 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Pale Ales & IPAs</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Hop-forward with citrus, pine, or tropical notes. IPAs are stronger and more bitter than pale ales.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-4">
    <h3 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Wheat beers</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Often cloudy, with banana and clove notes (German) or orange and coriander (Belgian).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-4">
    <h3 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Stouts & Porters</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Dark, roasty, with coffee and chocolate flavours. Porters are generally lighter than stouts.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>What style names don't tell you</h2>
<p>
  Style names aren't regulated, so different brewers may interpret them differently. A "Belgian-style" beer from the US may taste quite different from one brewed in Belgium. Use style as a guide, not a guarantee.

<h2>Health warnings and responsible drinking logos</h2>
<p>
  Beer labels across Europe carry various health and safety symbols. Some are legally required;
  others are voluntary industry initiatives.
</p>

<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">Pregnancy warning</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      A pictogram of a pregnant woman with a line through it indicates the product contains alcohol
      and advises against consumption during pregnancy. This symbol has been mandatory in France
      since 2007 for all beverages above 1.2% ABV, and its use is spreading across Europe. The EU
      Alcohol Labelling Regulation adopted in 2023 will require health warnings — including a
      pregnancy warning — on all alcohol products sold in the EU.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">Drink-driving warning</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      A symbol of a car or steering wheel with a line through it indicates the product should not be
      consumed before driving. This appears across Europe, either as a voluntary industry addition or
      combined with the pregnancy warning into a single symbol strip.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">Minimum age logos</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      An "18+" symbol indicates the product should not be sold to anyone under 18. In most European
      countries the minimum age is 18 for all alcohol. Some countries set a lower minimum age for
      beer and wine than for spirits, though the general trend across Europe has been toward a single
      minimum age of 18 for all alcohol. Labels showing "18+" may not always reflect the specific
      rules in every country where the beer is sold.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 shadow-sm p-5">
    <h3 class="font-semibold">"Drink Responsibly" logos</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
      Many labels carry voluntary messages such as "Enjoy Responsibly" or "Please Drink Responsibly",
      or logos from national public health bodies (such as Drinkaware in the UK and Ireland, or
      national equivalents elsewhere in Europe). These are voluntary initiatives and carry no
      regulatory status. Their presence does not indicate any form of regulatory compliance.
